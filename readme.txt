Cocktail picker user manual
------------------------------------

The cocktail picker is a simple app that requires you to enter 3 choices from a user input form.

 - There is a menu selection input control for you to choose your personality type.
  The only options are: 'Strong' or 'Smooth'

- There is a menu radio button input control for you to choose your colour preference.
  The only options are: 'Bright' or 'Medium' or 'Minimal'

- There is a menu selection input control for you to choose your alcohol preference.
  The only options are: 'No' or 'Yes'

The cocktail picker will process your choices and choose from a pre-defined list of 
cocktail drinks to reactively present back to you a recommended drink for inspiration.

Enjoy!
